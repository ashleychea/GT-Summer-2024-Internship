## Week 2: June 17 - June 21

### What I worked on each day 

During my second week at Grant Thornton (GT), Here's what I accomplished each day:

- Monday (6/17): Spoke to my PMD to go over expectations for my internship.


- Tuesday (6/18): Had several meetings, starting with our 1 week recruiter check-in, 1st call for my client project with another Cybersecurity & Privacy Intern, had an introduction call with my managers that are over my intern project & had a call with a Senior Associate based in San Diego to talk about the OneTrust platform.


- Wednesday (6/19): Had my first meeting with my Career coach and spent the rest of the day studying/reviewing material from last week and the meetings I had on Tuesday.


- Thursday (6/20): Had a meeting to learn about GT's Community Project, met with my client team twice to layout a road map for our current project that included Maturity Assessments (understand ISO 27701-2019 A & B Contorls), I also had a lunch with my buddy who was a previous Cybersecurity & Privacy Intern in 2022 and is now a full time associate.


- Friday (6/21): Summer Friday, but I got a lot of work done this day. Our GT Community Project officially kicked off in the Dallas office, we were assigned teams and were able to look for the organization we wanted to represent. On this day, I also met with my managers in-charge of the Cyber Intern project to just go over a few questions and expectations for my teammate and I. 

### What I learned each day:

- Monday (6/17): During my call with my PMD, I learned exactly why I was chosen for the position (not because of my extensive background, but because he knew I could get the job done and he saw the passion I have for Cybersecurity and learning). It was an amazing feeling to say the least because I've put so much into my learning and understanding of Cybersecurity & Privacy and to see it actually pay off is amazing. I was also able to learn more about his background and how he got to the level he did, and gain tips and insiders to really leverage my 8-week journey at GT. Lastly, he told me to ask questions and be open to feedback and to remember that it's not also a bad thing.

### Challenges I faced

Some of the challenges I faced were:

- One of the challenges I faced this week was understanding my client project objective as well as picking an organization to represent for GT's community project

### How I overcame them

- The way I over came them both was to first, research. I needed to see if I had exhausted all my resources before I asked for help. Once I knew I had exhausted all my resources, I then proceeded to ask for help. Because I asked for help, I was able to get pressing questions answered and examples for better understanding and reference. 

### Feedback I received

- The feedback I received this week is that I'm a great communicator, I take initiative and I'mm not afraid to ask for help which are the attributes for a great leader.

### Improvements

- Asking questions early on, processing my

Moving forward into Week 3, I plan on taking the time to review everything I've learned the last two weeks, work alongside senior associates and see where I can collaborate the most individually.
