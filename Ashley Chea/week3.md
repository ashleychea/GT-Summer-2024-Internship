## Week 3: June 24 - June 28

### What I worked on each day 

During my third week at Grant Thornton (GT), Here's what I accomplished each day:

- Monday (6/24): Met with my GT Community Project team to go over the organization that we picked and how we wanted to go about our presentation. 


- Tuesday (6/25): Met with my engagement team to continue dicussing our client work and the work myself and the other intern were assigned (Maturity Assessments). Got to participate in a give back event with fellow Dallas Interns, which was really fun and easy going. Had my bi-weekly intern check-in for my engagement project with my team to see if I had any questions of anything. Did a bit of Saviynt (IAM) training with a fellow Associate who is a SME in this area. Lastly, did a nationwide Cyber Intern Weekly check-in where we were able to get any questions answered. 


- Wednesday (6/26): Engagement work review with my client team and then a meeting with my intern project managers to discuss the project a bit more and get questions answered and the goal of the project clarified. 


- Thursday (6/27): Another engagement project check-in to see how we were coming along with the tool-kit (Maturity Assessment).


- Friday (6/28): 1/2 Summer Friday, just a day for reviewing. 

### What I learned each day:

- Monday (6/24): Today was really brief in terms of learning. I didn't learn any new material but I was able to learn more about my team members who are doing the community project. It was great to get different prospectives on things I would often overlook. 


- Tuesday (6/25): I was able to learn more about my engagement work in reference to where we stand (I know this sounds a bit repetitive but I promise there are different conversations being had every time we speak). During our giving back event I learned that though life my be going fast, it's okay to stop and count your blessings while also encouraging others that "no matter what, everything will be okay." I was also able to hear more about Saviynt and even see a live demo of what it looks like in client work so that was really great. Overall, a great day of learning and gratefulness. 


- Wednesday (6/26): I spent this day dividing my time between my client engagement work & my intern project. I spent a lot of time researching this day for my intern project. I was able to learn a lot about DORA and how to make it simpler to understand. I gave myself some time to actually break the material down and make it easier for me. 


- Thursday (6/27): This day was more of a review, but I was able to get help on how to do the maturity assessments more effectively and ensure that the right information is documented and understood by all levels of the organization.


- Friday (6/28): I spent this day getting myself more familiar with my intern project and actually understanding what DORA is and who it impacts, why and the aftermath of it going into play. It was really interesting to see it compared to other industry standards such as NIST, ISO & even CIS CSC


### Challenges I faced

Some of the challenges I faced were:

- This was a smooth week so I didn't have any challenges that I faced. I was able to get my work done and ask necessary questions.

### How I overcame them

- N/A

### Feedback I received

- No direct feedback from anyone, but the feedback I gave myself was to continue to make the best of my time and be open to just learning new things and asking questions. Also, taking notes and making sure to track my daily activites. 

### Improvements

- There's always room for improvement, so I would say something I could be better at is my time management. Create a mapped out schedule of everything I want to accomplish hour by hour would be super helpful. Though I know that everything won't always be exact, it would give me a better idea on how to prioritize my day. 

Moving forward into Week 4, I plan on taking the time to review everything I've learned the last three weeks and continue my efforts in my pursuit of Privacy Engineering.
