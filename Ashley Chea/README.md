# Summer 2024 Internship Progress Tracker - Ashley Chea

## About Me

Additionally, please share what you hope to gain from this internship and how you plan to contribute to the team. -->

Hello, my name is Ashley Chea (Ash for short) & I am a 2nd year Cybersecurity graduate student at Kennesaw State University projected to graduate December 2024. I am passionate about creating solutions that people implement daily, solutions that eases lives, and one that causes an impact. I love researching, collaborting with experienced professionals, and expanding my skills-set daily. Outside of work and academics I'm a huge sports fan (Go Braves! Fly Eagles Fly!), I enjoy fashion, I love being outdors & when I cook I think I'm on Iron Chef America. 

Before starting my internship, I worked as a Full-Stack Software Engineer for one of the world's largest banks.
Throughout my journey, as much as I have gathered some experience in the mentioned field, I continually seek to improve my skills and become a better Cybersecurity professional by the day.

I am currently an intern at Grant Thornton Advisors LLC in Dallas, Texas and one of the reasons I got interested in pursuing an internship there is because they have a culture of **"CLEARR"**; COLLABORATION, LEADERSHIP, EXCELLENCE, AGILITY, RESPECT, RESPONSBILITY, which I resonated with really well. I was also interested in the organization because of how they carry out their operations, plan & structure to their clients. Working here will be an adjustment given that I've never worked in Cybersecurity or Data Privacy before, but I had to leave my comfort zone, follow my passion and grow, so here I am, embracing every change like a capterpillar turning into a butterfly ðŸ¦‹.

I am confident that during the internship, I'll learn how to plan and execute great solutions, various industry standards (Global and Local), methodologies, and implementations, collaborate with larger teams, improve on technical, soft, and interpersonal skills, and so much more. In summary, I will be "presentation-ready."

I plan on contributing to any projects I'm put on to gain knowledge and understanding of various tools and methodologies.
I look forward to researching and expanding my knowledge in the realm of Cybersecurity & Privacy as well as leveraging my background in Software Engineering to get better results for our clients and their consumers.
I am delighted to be part of the team; looking forward to a great experience here at GT.
