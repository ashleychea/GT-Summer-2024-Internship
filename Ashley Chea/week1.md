## Week 1: June 10 - June 14

### What I worked on each day 

During my first week at Grant Thornton (GT), I spent most of my time getting set up, getting to know my team and familiarizing myself with the tools and technologies I'll be using during my internship. Here's what I accomplished each day:

- Monday (6/10): Got my laptop, set up my login credentials, spent the day in orientation with all the other interns nationwide. Got lunch & got to know my other interns more. Spent time working through the "Intern Playbook". Ended the day with a trivia game for all the Summer 2024 interns in the Dallas Office. 

- Tuesday (6/11): Day 2 of Training. Got an overview of my internship, Discussed professionalism, Took a Policy Quiz & had an Office Panel with Associates, Senior Associates & Managers.

- Wednesday (6/12): Day 3 of Training. Split up into my respective service line (Cybersecurity & Privacy with the Risk Advisory sector). Attended 3 workshops (Culture Conversation, Consulting 101 & Deliverable Training). Had a Q&A Session with Senior Associates who have been at GT for a few years. Did some self-study on LinkedIn learning to learn "Security Frameworks Fundamentals" & "Advanced PowerPoint Training" from a GT employee on our learning platform, Core.

- Thursday (6/13): Day 4 of Training. Did LinkedIn Learning training on "Learning GDPR". Had a 3 workshops (Privacy 101, Building Your Network and Security 101). Had a stand up call to go over what it a day to day looks like from the perspective of a current Associate. Played a Cyber Trivia Game with the other 7 Cybersecurity & Privacy Interns across the firm. Ended the day with more self-study within GDPR to get familiar with that standard.

- Friday (6/14): Summer Friday's (Firm-wide policy where everyone only works for 1/2 of the work day). Used this day to catch up on work and review material from Week 1 of training. 

### What I learned each day:

- Monday (6/10): I learned about the GT culture and why CLEARR (Collaboration, Leadership, Excellence, Agility, Respect & Responsibility) plays such a big role in everything they do here. I also learned how my contributions this summer will help the overall goals of my team. I briefly spoke to my manager and set up a lunch with him on Thursday afternoon. I will be meeting the other 8 Cybersecurity & Privacy interns nationwide on Wednesday for us to start our formal training on being Cybersecurity & Privacy Consultants, building our network, learning more about the culutue and getting hands-on deliverable training. Lastly, I learned that asking questions and utilizing those around me will be the most valuable thing I do this Summer, especially as I go forward in my career.

- Tuesday (6/11): Day 2 was a bit like day one but just with a bit more details. I was able to learn professionalism at GT with the mindset of "dress for your day" which essentially means dress for success whether you're in the office or on the client site. 


- Wednesday (6/12):


- Thursday (6/13):


- Friday (6/14):


### Challenges I faced

Some of the challenges I faced were:

- I didn't face any pressing challenges this week given that it was the first week and everything was very straight-forward. I did however come across a scheduling interference on Thursday.

### How I overcame them

- The scheduling interference occured because I had a meeting with my managers, an office social event and Security 101 training. Thankfully I only missed about 30 minutes of the 1hr meeting so I was able to catch the tail-end of the meeting and get the slides emailed over to me for my review. 

### Feedback I received

- My client team liked how I took initiative to set up our first meeting for 6/18 to discuss the project we are on together. My manager & my coach also liked that I initiated the meeting with both of them to keep track of my progress. At the end of the day, it is my job to keep track of what I do and be able to reiterate that to anyone who asks, so that is what I did and it paid off. 

### Improvements

Moving forward into Week 2,

- During week 2, my focus is to meet with my team and discuss everything needed for our client work. I'll also be making time to meet with my managers and other co-workers to see how I can maximize my time here. Lastly, I'll be using the time that I'm not in meetings or responding to emails & IM's to review different privacy regulations and completing mandatory training to ensure that I am on top of my work and making the most of my time here.
