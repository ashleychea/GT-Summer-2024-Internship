### What I worked on each day 

During my first week at Grant Thornton (GT), I spent most of my time getting set up, getting to know my team and familiarizing myself with the tools and technologies I'll be using during my internship. Here's what I accomplished each day:

- Monday (6/10): Got my laptop, set up my login credentials, spent the day in orientation with all the other interns nationwide. Got lunch & got to know my other interns more. Spent time working through the "Intern Playbook". Ended the day with a trivia game for all the Summer 2024 interns in the Dallas Office. 

- Tuesday (6/11): Day 2 of Training. Got an overview of my internship, Discussed professionalism, Took a Policy Quiz & had an Office Panel with Associates, Senior Associates & Managers.

### What I learned each day:

- Monday (6/10): I learned about the GT culture and why CLEARR (Collaboration, Leadership, Excellence, Agility, Respect & Responsibility) plays such a big role in everything they do here. I also learned how my contributions this summer will help the overall goals of my team. I briefly spoke to my manager and set up a lunch with him on Thursday afternoon. I will be meeting the other 8 Cybersecurity & Privacy interns nationwide on Wednesday for us to start our formal training on being Cybersecurity & Privacy Consultants, building our network, learning more about the culutue and getting hands-on deliverable training. Lastly, I learned that asking questions and utilizing those around me will be the most valuable thing I do this Summer, especially as I go forward in my career.
