## Week 1: June 10 - June 14

*** What I worked on each day ***

During my first week at Grant Thornton (GT), I spent most of my time getting set up, getting to know my team and familiarizing myself with the tools and technologies I'll be using during my internship. Here's what I accomplished each day:

- Monday (6/10): Got my laptop, set up my login credentials, spent the day in orientation, got lunch to get to know my team and other interns better, ended the day with a social event for all the Summer 2024 interns.

- Tuesday (6/11):


- Wednesday (6/12):


- Thursday (6/13):


- Friday (6/14):

### What I learned each day:

- Monday (6/10): I learned about the GT culture and why CLEARR (Collaboration, Leadership, Excellence, Agility, Respect & Responsibility) plays such a big role in everything they do here. I also learned how my contributions this summer will help the overall goals of my team. Lastly, I learned that asking questions and utilizing those around me will be the most valuable thing I do this Summer, especially as I go forward in my career.
