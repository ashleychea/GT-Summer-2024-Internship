## Week 4: July 1 - July 5

### What I worked on each day 

During my fourth week at Grant Thornton (GT), Here's what I accomplished each day:

- Monday (7/1): 


- Tuesday (7/2):


- Wednesday (7/3): 


- Thursday (7/4): ***4TH OF JULY***


- Friday (7/5): ***4TH OF JULY OBSERVED***

### What I learned each day:

- Monday (7/1): 


- Tuesday (7/2):


- Wednesday (7/3): 


- Thursday (7/4): ***4TH OF JULY***


- Friday (7/5): ***4TH OF JULY OBSERVED***


### Challenges I faced

Some of the challenges I faced were:

- Organizing meeting notes

### How I overcame them

- I reached out to my senior associates to see if there was a specific format they wanted me to use to ensure the notes are accurate.

### Feedback I received

- No direct feedback since it was a short week.

### Improvements

- There's always room for improvement but I believe I've been doing really well with time management, asking questions and getting my work turned in a timely manner; but again, nothing is ever "done" so the work continues. 

Moving forward into Week 5, I'm looking forward to wrapping up the intern project and closing in on items with gaps.
