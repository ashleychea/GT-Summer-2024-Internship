## Week 4: July 1 - July 5

### What I worked on each day 

During my fourth week at Grant Thornton (GT), Here's what I accomplished each day:

- Monday (7/1): Met with my intern project leaders and had a midpoint check in to guage where we were at. 


- Tuesday (7/2): Had 3 meetings with my client engagement team (1 to have a touchbase about where we were on our client work and if we needed help with anything and the other 2 were actual meetings with the client to introduce new products that would be added to their network to help build out their privacy and compliance sectors). 


- Wednesday (7/3): Spent this time meeting with my intern project managers & my teammate. We used the 30 minutes that we had for this meeting to talk more about what direction we wanted the meeting to go i


- Thursday (7/4): ***4TH OF JULY***


- Friday (7/5): ***4TH OF JULY OBSERVED***

### Challenges I faced

Some of the challenges I faced were:

- Organizing meeting notes

### How I overcame them

- I reached out to my senior associates to see if there was a specific format they wanted me to use to ensure the notes are accurate.

### Feedback I received

- No direct feedback since it was a short week.

### Improvements

- There's always room for improvement but I believe I've been doing really well with time management, asking questions and getting my work turned in a timely manner; but again, nothing is ever "done" so the work continues. 

Moving forward into Week 5, I'm looking forward to wrapping up the intern project and closing in on items with gaps.
